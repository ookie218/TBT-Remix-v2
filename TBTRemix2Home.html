		<p>Kei Harris, was born and adopted in Wisconsin, lived in New Jersey for about seven years,

      	The genres that influenced him the most were rap, heavy metal, and punk. Composing lyrics and music had 
	  	always been an outlet for him until his grandfather died in January of 2011. Harris then began composing 
	  	music and writing for the purpose of impacting others. He immediately got involved with ministry, and 
	  	with his great friend C MC, founded "TruthBTold". Harris has a heart for people of all backgrounds and cultures.
	  	He strives to connect and minister to people of all ages and cultures, through music, and relationship. 
	  	His goal is to help people see God as a reality, and not just a concept in their life.</p>

		<p>Ookie Ebron got in contact with Kei (previously knowing him on social media, through a mutual friend of theirs from college), 
	  	and became a member "TruthBTold" the summer of 2014. <br /> <br />
	  
	  	Ookie Ebron was born in Albany, New York but moved to Richmond VA, after 7 years. He has always grown up in the church,
	  	but never had a relationship with Christ that he would understand for himself until the age of about 17. He was never too
	  	far gone into the world; always had a distasteful view on most things in society. His biggest enemy was himself and his own 
	  	desires. He would go on to chase after women to be his god; always needing companionship to cover the absence of love in his 
	  	life that only Jesus could fill. He would go on to have a life changing experience in 2010's Winterfest in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. 
      	The ministry of Jentezen Franklin and Eddie James among others began to open his mind to the Holy Spirit and allow God to do a work 
      	and change his life forever. Since that experience, Ookie has begun to bear his cross and venture into different aspects of ministry. 
	  	He served in children's ministry, street evangelism, and even pulpit ministry before God brought him into a season of music ministry 
	  	that would glorify Him and encourage others by experience and divine inspired words. Since beggining music, Ookie has been a part of 
	  	4 mixtape releases, various showcases, events, and plenty of bottles of VOSS Artesian water. God has placed him in a season in which he takes great delight in serving in and he 
	  	is looking forward to God opening doors to spread the Gospel.</p>
